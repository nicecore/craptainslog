NOTES
=====

- I think I will literally just edit the HTML and copy-paste each block of code for a log and keep pushing the other ones down until the month is done, then they will become index/august2023.html for example. Can transition to an SPA and a real back end later. But this is bare bones.


- Maybe we don't even need the hamburger menu in small mode. And instead of links to the weeks you can just click on past months.
