                    Depressing chat with C about what is possible and impossible this coming year. She wants me to get better, finally dig myself out of this hole and become the best version of myself. She wants me to take medication etc. She was disappointed that I decided to renew my contract here when she and I had just started talking again and is taking that as more of me waffling. I said I haven't been reconsidering whether I will move to LA right now, even after we reconnected recently, all I wanted was to see if we could understand each other better (for what purpose, now that I am stuck here another year, is a fair question though) and while I was so devastated and depressed over all this, and now with no income, they started pressing me to renew, I needed a roof over my head and the thought of moving anywhere, even down the street, was just too much, she and I had just barely reconnected and hadn't/haven't even begun to work out any of the stuff I talked about after the Texas trip.
                    <br><br>
                    She said what is she supposed to do now then, wait for me? No, I don't know. Neither of us thinks it's a good idea to start the daily phone calls and stuff like that that make us feel like we're in a relationship without actually being able to be together.<br><br>
                    I was crying and saying well I guess what you're saying is that we really have to just stop communication and move on from each other now, and she was insisting that wasn't what she was saying but I didn't know what else to conclude from it. I admitted that this thing between us, all these ups and downs, and breakups and rediscovering each other, had been a huge stumbling block for me for over a year now in getting better and focusing on myself because it occupies my mind so much and can just be so upsetting, I said I know it's the same for you and she said yeah.<br><br>
                    She was kind of giving me mixed signals and I think she's conflicted. She doesn't want us to just cut off contact and move on, she wants us to be in touch in some way, albeit with limits etc. Which to me sounds like a recipe for us staying in love. But she also said no to my idea of visiting her a few months down the road when I have a better income because she wouldn't be able to be intimate with me if she were seeing someone else. Which I take to mean she is ready to try giving other people a chance (and might be doing so already), whereas I really am not. As long as I have her on my mind even a little bit, I'm not going to seriously date anyone else because that's just not fair to them. I guess she either sees that differently or doesn't have me on her mind as much. I think she wants a relationship, she doesn't want to be alone, and now she knows she will have to wait at minimum a year for me to move out there, and she is not in as bad a place mentally/emotionally as I am so she probably feels like she has less work to do on herself and is more ready for that. Even if something doesn't have the same sparks we have, but is nice enough on paper or whatever, she is going to give it a real chance whereas I probably would not.
                    <br><br>
                    I really don't know what all of this means. I think I do have to accept some degree of moving on from her in this moment because a long-distance or pseudorelationship would likely be painful and stressful, and anyway she would say no to that even if I begged.  
                    I think she is trying to tell me at the same time that she loves me and what she wants most for me is to get better and overcome all of this, and that she still likes the idea of me being with her as the best version of myself, but also that the fact of the matter is that nothing is guaranteed now. I like the idea of getting better, doing a few more months of therapy, getting a new job, really getting a grip on everything, getting really into meditation, exercise, my health, being productive and creative and feeling like I'm in the best place of my entire life...and that you would be able to tell it by looking at me and speaking to me and seeing the fruits of my labor...and I am sure that in that state, whatever Caribel feels for me now would be so magnified...that she would have to meet someone with whom she has the same extremely rare connection/bond she has with me to tell me "I'm sorry, the moment really has passed, I have a good thing going with someone else" if I tell her next spring that I am dedicated to moving out there and am starting to sell off my stuff, etc. If she sees me growing and actually doing what I promised to do, actually working hard, making music, improving my health, etc. her love and admiration for me will grow. And in the meantime we will see what it is like to have a friendship without all the lovey dovey stuff, or at least without so much of it.
                    <br><br>
                    She agreed to talk to me again tonight and I promised to be less upset. I need to think about what I will suggest.
