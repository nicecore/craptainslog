            The last few days have been rough and I have smoked a little bit. Partly due to me hitting a wall in the project. Partly for some other reasons I can't identify. I think I've gone three weekends in a row and only gone out once so that could be it too. My only social activity is basketball. I think I need to be getting out of the house more but it's been hard because I'm still so tired in the mornings and for some reason can't just get up and shower and get out. Have had a huge problem keeping good food around to eat and have ordered Uber Eats a few times when I was trying not to order it at all. I'm undereating big time. It's the oil. Not going to take any this afternoon because I have a date, so that's good. Need to take a much smaller dose or none at all in the evenings so I can keep the house clean and make food instead of just sitting around and playing Rocket League and/or a little music. Trying to focus on the fact that I have just put a few overall very good weeks behind me and it's definitely a start. It may be a little slow going but there is no way I can fall back off now.
            <br><br>
            Received bad news today that we will supposedly start work again in October and not September. So insane. They have hired a project manager though which is a good sign that we actually will work. The horrible dollar keeps dropping against the peso. I seriously need to get this in writing because I cannot just work on my portfolio through September if I'm not 100% sure I won't get paid in October.

            Not really a productive day, but I did get a good cleaning of the house/some outside maintenance done and avoided the destructive stuff. Haven't smoked since August 8th! Not even having to lock up my money at this point. That feels really good.

            Had to pay about 80-85 dollars but the fridge seems fixed, comes with a one month written guarantee, and I've been advised to plug it into a surge protector because he believes a power shortage is what busted the part he had to replace.

            I cranked up the fridge's cold-o-meter to very high (I've always left it between 0 and 1 and the stuff in the back is practically frozen, so I knew something was wrong with it for a long time) and it actually does seem to be working, so I'm gonna leave it alone. If the frequent clicking continues I might ask someone to come check it out early next week anyway because it is probably a matter of time before it just stops working.

            A month or so ago, the kind of pain I felt in my legs on Tuesday night would've lasted four or five days, but the pain is almost all gone; must be the power of no smoking/drinking and also just enough pain over a period of time that body is healing quicker.
            <br><br>
            I haven't smoked (or drank but that is a much easier one to avoid) since last Tuesday. Vicky said I was already looking noticeably better. I will have a beer or two at La Maria's party but really would like to avoid even one cigarette. Party is on a terraza so people will be smoking. Just try to move away/find a new group to chat with if people start doing it. Or just say no if offered and remember how good it feels to get in bed knowing you haven't done it. If I eat a lot before I can very slowly drink one or two beers and not really feel much and that will also help. And if I fail, it's okay, I don't have to do it tomorrow, I can have another healthy weekend and keep the good days going.

            So much pain throughout my body from working out too hard and then playing hard basketball yesterday I think, so will stay home from basketball today, plus it's cold and wet out. Finishing Django tutorial is going slower than I'd hoped and the more I think about adapting that project into my language help social media site, the bigger the task seems and some aspects of it are quite daunting. But with the tutorial done, most of the work is done, and figuring out the rest will be on my own, which should be quicker than slogging through a tutorial, so we'll see.

            Refrigerator seems like it may be breaking down. It's clicking very frequently and this morning I discovered everything in the freezer was just cold, not frozen at all. Cranked up cold in the fridge part, then unplugged it, left it for a while, plugged it back in, and now freezer seems colder, but still not sure. Very bad time for this to happen.

            I have an appt with Dr. Randall tomorrow. Haven't smoked or drank since last Tuesday night. Will probably be unable to avoid a beer or two this weekend due to some social obligations but should be able to avoid a cigarette.

            Was offered a beer last night after basketball but was able to say no. Knew that it wouldn't just be one beer and that I'd want to smoke later too. Feels good to be able to say no to something. Gonna try to avoid environments where drinking happens until the family visits in September. Was planning to just play guitar after basketball but couldn't say no to Facetiming with C all evening. A nice night altogether.

            Even though C and I said we weren't going to be in a pseudo-relationship I'm finding myself always wanting to talk to her and hear from her and it's hurting. And when we do talk I overthink it and feel bad that she doesn't want to be as affectionate as I do, etc. Today found myself feeling like I'd rather go back to no contact. But just gotta power through it and keep working and doing stuff and avoiding alcohol and tobacco, that feels good. It helps to remind myself about my doubts about her, and how I don't feel that they'll ultimately get resolved. But I go back and forth between that and thinking that this time of just trying to be friends and connecting over reading and music, while I finally pull myself out of this rut and feel good for the first time in I don't even know how long, is going to bring us closer together and show me that I really do need to be with her. But sometimes I also think the only way I'm going to know if we need to be together is by just taking the leap of faith and doing it. Either way, taking care of myself is the best bet, because if she falls in love with someone else in the next few months, I will be able to handle it a lot better and it won't feel like the end of the world.

I will ask her about medications etc as one of the first things and what kind of dr. to look for, etc. Today has been a pretty decent day; first day in a while I feel like I'm edging towards real productivity and long days again. Blocking all distracting sites/apps is the only way to go. No smoking yesterday and I'm set up to continue avoiding that through the weekend. Should be a chill weekend of work, music, and tending to the house and patio. Eating better since Tuesday.

            <ul>
                <li>I have about enough money to get me through the end of October before I would need real help, but signs point to me getting paid again starting next month (September)</li>
                <li>Best approach however is to pretend like I am not getting paid in September</li>
                <li>Data Analytics and QA Analyst are the two mid-term positions I am gunning for and I can argue for both with a portfolio of web projects (as well as for an actual web dev job)</li>
                <li>It might also be worth it to spend 2-3 hours a day on a Data Analytics certification/course of some kind (Google has one)</li>
                <li>If it turns out I will not get paid in September, I should know early on and I will immediately begin looking for anything from the short-term jobs list</li>
                <li>In that case, by the end of September I should have something from that short-term list that is at least paying enough to cover most of my rent, and can ask Mom and Dad for help covering the rest for a few months until portfolio is completed/one of the mid-term jobs that pays at least around 2k is secured</li>
                <li>I feel strongly that once the portfolio is completed, and that will be within 2-3 months, that it won't be difficult to at least get one of the mid-term positions</li>

                <li>Continue locking up money in safe/blocking food ordering apps when necessary</li>
                <li>For the rest of August, focus more on portfolio/other preparation for securing one of the mid-term positions, only spend about an hour a day on job stuff</li>
                <li>Daily routine: Leave in morning, work at library for around 4 hours, go to shopping center and eat a little, go to gym, go home and eat more, work for another ~3 hours, then basketball, then music in the evenings.</li>

                <li>Tech Sales - Saying it's great money and you don't need a specific background, although looking at job postings they want sales, which I definitely don't have.</li>

        <div class="notes">
            Depressing chat with C about what is possible and impossible this coming year. She wants me to get better, finally dig myself out of this hole and become the best version of myself. She wants me to take medication etc. She was disappointed that I decided to renew my contract here when she and I had just started talking again and is taking that as more of me waffling. I said I haven't been reconsidering whether I will move to LA right now, even after we reconnected recently, all I wanted was to see if we could understand each other better (for what purpose, now that I am stuck here another year, is a fair question though) and while I was so devastated and depressed over all this, and now with no income, they started pressing me to renew, I needed a roof over my head and the thought of moving anywhere, even down the street, was just too much, she and I had just barely reconnected and hadn't/haven't even begun to work out any of the stuff I talked about after the Texas trip.
            <br><br>
            She said what is she supposed to do now then, wait for me? No, I don't know. Neither of us thinks it's a good idea to start the daily phone calls and stuff like that that make us feel like we're in a relationship without actually being able to be together.<br><br>
            I was crying and saying well I guess what you're saying is that we really have to just stop communication and move on from each other now, and she was insisting that wasn't what she was saying but I didn't know what else to conclude from it. I admitted that this thing between us, all these ups and downs, and breakups and rediscovering each other, had been a huge stumbling block for me for over a year now in getting better and focusing on myself because it occupies my mind so much and can just be so upsetting, I said I know it's the same for you and she said yeah.<br><br>
            She was kind of giving me mixed signals and I think she's conflicted. She doesn't want us to just cut off contact and move on, she wants us to be in touch in some way, albeit with limits etc. Which to me sounds like a recipe for us staying in love. But she also said no to my idea of visiting her a few months down the road when I have a better income because she wouldn't be able to be intimate with me if she were seeing someone else. Which I take to mean she is ready to try giving other people a chance (and might be doing so already), whereas I really am not. As long as I have her on my mind even a little bit, I'm not going to seriously date anyone else because that's just not fair to them. I guess she either sees that differently or doesn't have me on her mind as much. I think she wants a relationship, she doesn't want to be alone, and now she knows she will have to wait at minimum a year for me to move out there, and she is not in as bad a place mentally/emotionally as I am so she probably feels like she has less work to do on herself and is more ready for that. Even if something doesn't have the same sparks we have, but is nice enough on paper or whatever, she is going to give it a real chance whereas I probably would not.
            <br><br>
            I really don't know what all of this means. I think I do have to accept some degree of moving on from her in this moment because a long-distance or pseudorelationship would likely be painful and stressful, and anyway she would say no to that even if I begged.  
            I think she is trying to tell me at the same time that she loves me and what she wants most for me is to get better and overcome all of this, and that she still likes the idea of me being with her as the best version of myself, but also that the fact of the matter is that nothing is guaranteed now. I like the idea of getting better, doing a few more months of therapy, getting a new job, really getting a grip on everything, getting really into meditation, exercise, my health, being productive and creative and feeling like I'm in the best place of my entire life...and that you would be able to tell it by looking at me and speaking to me and seeing the fruits of my labor...and I am sure that in that state, whatever Caribel feels for me now would be so magnified...that she would have to meet someone with whom she has the same extremely rare connection/bond she has with me to tell me "I'm sorry, the moment really has passed, I have a good thing going with someone else" if I tell her next spring that I am dedicated to moving out there and am starting to sell off my stuff, etc. If she sees me growing and actually doing what I promised to do, actually working hard, making music, improving my health, etc. her love and admiration for me will grow. And in the meantime we will see what it is like to have a friendship without all the lovey dovey stuff, or at least without so much of it.
            <br><br>
            She agreed to talk to me again tonight and I promised to be less upset. I need to think about what I will suggest.
